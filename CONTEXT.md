## üöÄ Elevator Pitch

**CodexVault** is a next-generation ChatGPT conversation management system designed for developers who rely on AI to accelerate their workflows. It transforms large `.json` ChatGPT exports into a browsable, editable, and taggable interface for deep conversation analysis, vault-based grouping, and AI-powered summarization.

The app lets you organize, filter, and navigate thousands of AI exchanges, create intelligent summaries, track project-specific threads, and generate reusable context blocks ‚Äî enabling high-fidelity memory and seamless context injection across multiple AI sessions and projects.

Whether you're managing your AI-assisted development history or building context-aware memory systems, CodexVault becomes your permanent, structured log of thought.

## üìò Glossary of Terms

| Term          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Raw**       | The original `.json` file exported from ChatGPT, containing all conversations and metadata. Immutable and read-only once imported. |
| **Exchange**  | A pair of user prompt and assistant response. Contains full text, timestamps, and optional metadata (tags, notes, etc.). |
| **Conversation** | A sequence of Exchanges. Derived directly from the Raw file or user-curated. Can be edited, tagged, summarized, or removed. |
| **Vault**     | A logical grouping of Conversations (e.g., by project or theme). Can be created manually from selected Conversations. Supports attached metadata and AI-generated summaries. |
| **ContextMemory** | A summary object representing the distilled essence of one or more Exchanges or Conversations. Generated by LLM. Exportable as `.md` or `.json`. |
| **Summarization Object** | A metadata object linked to a Vault or Conversation, containing LLM-generated summaries, merge instructions, or context blocks. |
| **View Mode** | The mode that determines UI context: `ALL`, `VAULT`, `CONVERSATION`, or `EXCHANGE`. Impacts panel layout and interactions. |

## üß† What the App Does

### üóÇÔ∏è Load and Parse Raw Data
- Open a `.json` file exported from ChatGPT.
- Parse all Conversations and Exchanges into editable memory.
- Treat the Raw as a read-only data source (no modifications allowed).

### üìë Browse, Filter, and Select
- Left panel: tree- or list-based view of all Conversations or Vaults.
- Right panel: expanded preview of selected Conversation or Exchange.
- Expand/collapse at any tree level (Vault ‚Üí Conversation ‚Üí Exchange).

### üß± Vault Creation
- Select multiple Conversations and group them into a named Vault.
- Vaults persist in local or cloud storage.
- Vaults support tagging, search, and context generation.

### üí¨ Exchange Preview
- View and scroll entire prompt/response blocks.
- Hover menu allows summarization or tagging.
- Exchange-level metadata includes timestamps and tags.

### üß† AI Summarization
- Summarize:
  - A single Exchange
  - A full Conversation
  - An entire Vault
- Generates ContextMemory objects using LLM API.
- Supports iterative summarization with evolving instruction prompts.

### üîç Search and Tagging
- Full-text search across all prompts and responses.
- Filter by tags, view mode, or Vault membership.
- Manual or automatic tagging supported.

### üíæ Exporting Context
- Export summaries as:
  - Markdown (`.md`)
  - Structured JSON (`.json`)
- Used for ChatGPT injection, versioned logs, or context-aware development.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Storage and Persistence
- Persistent session memory (conversations and vaults are restored on app restart).
- Google Drive integration planned for syncing Vaults and summaries to the cloud.
- Local file export and import also supported.
